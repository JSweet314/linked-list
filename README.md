### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
#### Phase One
  The user should be able to input a title and URL into the appropriate fields

  When the user clicks on the button for creating the bookmark, it should be added to the bookmarks section

  When the user clicks on the “Mark as Read” button:

  A class of .read should be added to the bookmark

  If it already has the class of .read, it should be removed
  When the user clicks on the “Remove” button, the link should be removed from the page
  
#### Phase Two
  If the user omits the title or the URL, the application should not create the link and should instead display an error.

  The application should be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile.

#### Phase Three
  The button for creating links should be disabled if there are no contents in the title or URL fields.

  The application should be able to keep count of the total number of links currently on the page.

  The application should be able to keep count of the total number of read and unread links currently on the page.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* JS owns github repo, SL contributor
* use git, name branches with leading initials (ex. jsphase1)

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Grains of salt
* Direct, honest, punctual

### Agenda to discuss project launch:

#### Ideas:
* using rems's to simplify responsive design

#### Tools:
* Sublime, git, atom, github, chrome dev tools

#### Additional Notes:
* WOOOO FUN TIME!
